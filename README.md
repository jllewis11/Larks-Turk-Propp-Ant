Introduction: This is an extension to Turk & Propp Ant called the Lark's Ant.  Lark's ant is extended by adding a mode where the ant will sometimes ignore the color changes and instead, continue in a straight line for a sequence of cell moves.  This program will run for a total of 2,000 moves and the ant will stop.  This will be programmed in HTML and JavaScript while using the JS library called P5.

External Requirement: P5.js library

Setup and Installation: No installation necessary

To run the program, simply open index-js-p5-example.html in a browser.

Features: 
Larks ant:
The ant will change between Normal or Straight-Countdown Mode. The ant will determine which color it is currently on in normal mode to determine the next direction. If the ant is yellow, it will change to countdown mode forcing the ant to only go straight for a certain amount of time before returning to normal mode.
  
Bugs: None
